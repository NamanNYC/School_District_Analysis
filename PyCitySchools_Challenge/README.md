# School District Analysis

## Overview

Evidence of academic dishonesty has been shown in the files to Maria and her supervisor by the school board. Specifically, the ninth graders at Thomas High School. The overview of this project is to confirm the academic dishonesty data in the file and replace with something that will show that the inital numbers were dishonest.

## Results
1. How is the district summary affected?
The district summary is not affected at all, with the Average Math Score for Thomas High School at 83.350937% in both scenarios, for example. 

2. How is the school summary affected?
The school summary, like the district summary, is unaffected. 

3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance by Thomas High School being removed from the top 5 highest graded schools.

4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
the math and reading scores were negligibly affected, to the point where it was not apparant or visible. 
- Scores by school spending
The school spending data is slightly affected in the same way the math and reading scores by grade were affected: invisible amount. The amount of per capita spending by Thomas High School, however, was not affected by the dtop in score average.
- Scores by school size
The overall passing percentage by school size is not changed.
- Scores by school type
Removing the 9th graders' scores does not affect the Scores by school type.

## Summary
5. Four changes in the updated School District Analysis are the following:
- Thomas High School was in the top 5 before replacing the scores with NaNs. It is no longer in the top 5 because of replacement with NaNs.
- All the 9th graders' removal caused the whole of the 9th graders' scores to decrease.
- The scores of grades 10th - 12th were too low to keep Thomas High School in the top 5, but the overall grade average in the school is impacted by the 9th graders' scores.
- The district data is less affected by the removal of the 9th graders' scores than the Thomas High School's data.
